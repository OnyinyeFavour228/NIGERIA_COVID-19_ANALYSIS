    " * I used Python for this analysis.\n",

    " The John Hopkins daily data is on the confirmed, death and recovered cases. The vulnerability index and budget data were computed for each state in Nigeria.The Gdp data was computed for each quarter from the year 2014 to 2020.\n",
    " * I extacted the daily data for Nigeria from the John Hopkins global daily data.\n",
    " * I converted the 'Date' column in the Nigeria daily data from object data type to datetime data type\n",
    " * I used Pandas diff method to find the derivate of the total cases.\n",
    " * I log transformed the total cases columns to reduce the skewness in the plots\n",
    " * I used Pandas melt function on the Budget and GDP dataframe to change the dataframe format to enable a more comprehensive plot\n",
    " * I used matplotlib and different seaborn visualization plots to examine relationships and explore the data"
