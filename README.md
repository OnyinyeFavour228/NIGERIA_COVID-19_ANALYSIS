COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by Corona virus. It affected major parts of the world including Nigeria. After Nigeria recorded its first case on the 27th of February, 2020; several activities in the country were affected as lockdown & curfews were observed and major airports were shut down.
This is an analysis of the effects of COVID-19 in Nigeria. Python was used to collect data, perform analysis and create visualization.
## Data Sourcing 
* I extracted COVID-19 data across all the 37 states in Nigeria from NCDC website using web scraping with Python.
* I imported Global COVID-19 daily data on confirmed cases, death and recovered cases from Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CSSE) github repository.
* Ustacky provided me with the following datasets:
  + Vulnerability Index data for the 37 states in Nigeria
  + Nigeria GDP for each quarter of the year from 2014 to 2020
  + Budget data for each state in Nigeria.
